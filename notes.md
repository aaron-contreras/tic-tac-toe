# Computer vs Human version implementation notes

I have found a "perfect match" strategy on wikipedia so let's implement that as the computer's logic to play against a Human "A.I." (in quotes yeah...)

First let's set up the task list of things to be done for this version

- [x] Read up on rubocop
- [x] Implement rubocop into my project
- [ ] Break down the logic of the computer's moves
  - [ ] Easy
    - Computer plays random moves
  - [ ] Medium
  - [ ] Extreme
  - [ ] Computer cheating mode lol
